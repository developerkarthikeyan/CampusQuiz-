    <title>CTS Aptitude Questions Practice App</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
    <!-- Chosen Palette: Calm Harmony (Warm Neutrals) -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: The SPA is designed as an interactive quiz platform. A sidebar allows users to select a specific aptitude topic (e.g., Ages, Geometry) or view all questions. The main area displays the questions for the selected topic in a scrollable list of cards. Users can click an option to get immediate feedback (correct/incorrect highlighting) and see their score update. This structure was chosen to transform the static document into an active learning tool, allowing for focused practice and self-assessment, which is more effective for exam preparation than passively reading a list. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices: Report Info: Aptitude questions and answers. Goal: Interactive practice. Presentation: Questions are displayed in individual cards with clickable buttons for options. Interaction: Clicking a topic button filters the questions. Clicking an answer button checks for correctness and provides visual feedback (color change). A new "Explain Answer" button appears after answering, which calls the Gemini API to generate and display a step-by-step solution. A "Generate Similar Question" button also appears, calling Gemini to create a new, on-the-fly practice problem based on the original. Justification: This card-based quiz format with immediate feedback and AI-powered explanations/question generation is highly intuitive and engaging for a practice test application. Library/Method: Vanilla JS for logic, Tailwind CSS for styling, Gemini API for explanations and question generation. -->
    <!-- CONFIRMATION: NO SVG graphics used. NO Mermaid JS used. -->
